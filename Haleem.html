<h3>3.Haleem</h3>
<p>They say you will keep coming back to Hyderabad for the yummy Haleem. During the month of Ramadan, there is a high demand for it and most restaurants make it, but it gets sold out quickly. Haleem is a healthy and delicious stew made of meat, lentils, and pounded wheat. It is topped with dry fruits, saffron, ghee, and served hot. Keep in mind that all joints donâ€™t make it throughout the year. </p>
